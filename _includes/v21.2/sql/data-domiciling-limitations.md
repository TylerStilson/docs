Using CockroachDB as part of your approach to data domiciling has several limitations:

- Additional metadata about the objects in a schema may be stored in [system ranges](architecture/distribution-layer.html#meta-ranges), system tables, etc. For example, this metadata may include table and index names, and primary key information. CockroachDB synchronizes these system ranges and system tables across nodes. This synchronization does not respect any multi-region settings applied via either the [multi-region SQL statements](multiregion-overview.html), or the low-level [zone configs](configure-replication-zones.html) mechanism.
- [Zone configs](configure-replication-zones.html) can be used for data placement but these features were historically built for performance, not for domiciling. Further, the way CockroachDB performs replica placement is currently heuristic-based, and the zone config settings may leave some decision making capacity to the system, and it may not place replicas according to your domiciling needs. For more information, see [Configure Replication Zones](configure-replication-zones.html#types-of-constraints).
- Make sure your [log files](logging-overview.html) are stored according to the legal requirements of the jurisdictions you're operating in. For example, it may be easiest to store your log files for a multi-region cluster in the locality with the most restrictive subset of regulations.
- If you start a node with a [`--locality`](cockroach-start.html#locality) flag that says the node is in region _A_, but the node is actually running in some region _B_, data domiciling based on the inferred node placement will not work. A CockroachDB node only knows its locality based on the text supplied to the `--locality` flag; it can not ensure that it is actually running in that physical location.
